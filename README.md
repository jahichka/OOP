Object-Oriented Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that I have developed while studying Object-Oriented Programming. 
Each project demonstrates various concepts and techniques related to OOP, including encapsulation, type conversion, m
emory management, working with pointers and addresses, and iterators etc.

Encapsulation is an essential principle in object-oriented programming that 
promotes data hiding and abstraction. In my projects, I have utilized encapsulation to create classes 
and objects that encapsulate related data and behavior, ensuring that data is accessed and modified through appropriate methods.

Type conversion, also known as type casting, involves converting the data type of an object or variable into another. 
Throughout my projects, I have employed type conversion techniques to handle situations where data needs to be converted 
from one type to another, ensuring compatibility and smooth data manipulation.

Efficient memory management is crucial in any programming endeavor. In the context of object-oriented programming, 
I have incorporated memory management techniques to allocate and deallocate memory for objects, preventing memory leaks 
and optimizing resource utilization. By leveraging dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, my projects demonstrate a responsible 
approach to memory management.

Pointers and addresses are fundamental concepts in C++ programming. In my projects, I have extensively utilized pointers to access 
and manipulate memory addresses, allowing for dynamic memory allocation, efficient memory usage, and improved performance. By effectively 
working with pointers, I have been able to create flexible and powerful solutions.
Iterators

Iterators are a powerful tool for traversing and manipulating data structures. In the context of my projects, I have made use of iterators
to iterate over various containers, such as arrays, lists, and maps. This approach has facilitated efficient data manipulation, enabling 
me to perform operations on each element of a container systematically.

The repository is organized into separate folders, each representing a different project related to Object-Oriented Programming. 
Feel free to explore each project folder to gain insights into how I have applied encapsulation, type conversion, memory management,
worked with pointers and addresses, and utilized iterators in different scenarios.


Thank you for your interest in my Object-Oriented Programming projects. I hope they provide valuable insights into the concepts discussed 
above and inspire further exploration of this fascinating programming paradigm.
